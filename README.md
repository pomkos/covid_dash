# How tos
## Run

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/pomkos/covid_dash
cd covid_dash
```

2. Create a conda environment (optional):

```
conda create --name "covid_env"
```

3. Activate environment, install python, install dependencies.

```
conda activate covid_env
conda install python=3.8
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Start the application:
```
streamlit run covid_dash.py
```
5. Access the portfolio at `localhost:8501`

## Host

1. Create a new file outside the `covid_dash` directory:

```
cd
nano covid_dash.sh
```

2. Paste the following in it, then save and exit:

```
#!/bin/bash

source ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

cd ~/covid_dash
conda activate covid_env

nohup streamlit run covid_dash.py --server.port 8504 &
```

3. Edit crontab so portfolio is started when server reboots

```
crontab -e
```

4. Add the following to the end, then save and exit

```
@reboot /home/covid_dash.sh
```

5. Access the portfolio at `localhost:8504`
